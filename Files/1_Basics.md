# Theory

## Compiler vs Interpreter

- Compilation of source code is done only once
- Compiler generates a separate executable(.exe) file
- Translation of source code to machine code is done only once, so we don't compiler to excute our program.
- The compiled program are fast because they gets executed independently.
- Language is easy (program doesn't executes if there's single error)

- It translates the source code into machine code line by line, and then excutes the line
- We need browser/Interpreter every time we want to run the code. (Translation happens every time we want to run the code)
- Interpreted programs are slow because they get executed inside the interpreter
- Language is difficult (program executes until the error is encountered)

## Programming Paradigm

- Monolothic Programming (single file - entire program)
- Procedural/Modular/Functional Programming (Breaking the program into functions : C language)
- Object Oriented Programming (C++ language)

# Basics

## Datatypes

- Int data type range (Assuming 2 bytes)
  bits : 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

  MSB is used to represent sign of the number
  0 for positive, 1 for negative

  we're remaining with 15 bits to represent the number

  so, 2^15 = 32768

  - 0 | 0 to 32767 (positive numbers)
  - 1 | 0 to 32767 (negative numbers)
    since, there can't be -0, so considering upto -32768.

- Char data type range (1 byte)
  bits : 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

  we know, 2^7 = 128

  - 0 | 0 to 127 (positive numbers)
  - 1 | 0 to 127 (negative numbers)
    since, there can't be -0, so considering upto -128

> **Note:** Negative numbers are always stored in 2's complement
>
> for example, 12 = 0000000000001100
>
> -12 : 12's 1's complement = 1111111111110011 : add 1 to it = 1111111111110100
>
> -12 = 1111111111110100
>
> For viewing decimal of a binary negative number (e.g. 1111111111110100)
>
> we has to find 2's complement of this number and then convert it to decimal and then add -ve sign.

## Data type modifiers

- usigned (can only be used with int and char)

  `unsigned int` will have range 0 to 65535 , since It won't contain any negative numbers (only positive numbers)

  we know, 2^16 = 65536

  `unsigned chat` will have range 0 to 255, since it won't contain any negative numbers (only positive numbers)

  we know, 2^8 = 256

- long (cannot be used with char)

  `long int` will have size 4 bytes (Initially 2 bytes)

  `long float` will have size 8 bytes (Initially 4 bytes)

  `long double` will have size 10/16 bytes (Initially 8 bytes)

  > **Note:** : long float = double , so no need to use long float

## Initialization

These are different ways to initialize int

```cpp
    int day = 1;
    int day(1);
    int day = (1);
    int day {1};
    int day = {1};
```

## Literals

```cpp
    int a = 10;
    int a = 010; // Octal representation if 8
    int a = 0x41; // Hexadecimal representation of 65
```

> **Note:** : the calculations will happen in decimal system only , by default

```cpp
    long price = 65359L;
    float price = 12.5F;
```

```cpp
    char section = 'A';
    char section = 65;
```

### Coersion

If a value is converted to required datatype internally, then it is called coersion.

```cpp
    char x = 65.6;          => A
```

```cpp
    float x = 123.45F;        => 123.45
```

```cpp
    float x = 123e2F;       => 12300
```

```cpp
    float x = 123e-2F;       => 1.23
```

## Operators and Expressions

If two integers are divided then, the result will also be of the integer type;

```cpp
    int a=13, b=5,c;
    c = a/b;                => 2
```

To get original result

```cpp
    int a=13, b=5;
    float c;                                    // c should hold the float value
    c = (float) a/b;             => 2.6         // Implicit type casting

```

```cpp
    int a=13;
    float c;
    c = a / 5.0;                => 2.6
```

> **Note:** : % operator can be performed on "int" and "char" , but not on "float"

### Compound Assignment

```cpp
    sum = sum + a + b + c;
```

is same as the following

```cpp
    sum += a + b + c;
```

## Overflow

When the datatype value is increased by its limit, then it will overflow
and the result will be in cyclic order. (-128 | 0 | 127)

```cpp
    char b=127;
    b++;
    cout<<(int)b<<endl;         => -128 //since 128 value doesn't exist for char
```

```cpp
    char d=-128;
    d--;
    cout<<(int)d<<endl;         => 127 //since -129 value doesn't exist for char
```

## Left shift and right shift

```cpp
    char a=5, b, i=1;
    b = j<<i; // left shift by 1
    cout<<(int)b<<endl;            => 10 // value is a*(2^i)
```

```cpp
    char a=20, b, i=1;
    b = a>>1; // right shift by 1
    cout<<(int)m<<endl;             => 10 // value is a/(2^i)
```

> **Note:** : signed bits are not disturbed in the shift operation

## Enum and typedef (user defined data types)

```cpp
               0    1    2    3    4    5   6
    enum day {mon, tue, wed, thu, fri, sat, sun};
    day d = mon;    // d will get value 0;
```

```cpp
                      2    3    4     5   6    7
    enum day {mon=1, tue, wed, thu, fri, sat, sun};
```

```cpp
                      2           6    7          10
    enum day {mon=1, tue, wed=5, thu, fri, sa=9, sun};
```

```cpp
    typedef int marks;
    marks m1, m2, m3;
```

# Conditional Statements

## Dynamic Declaration

This method is not memory efficient because it is declared in the main function and will occupy the memory until the program terminates(main function gets over).

```cpp
    int c = a + b;
    if (c > 10) {
        // do something
    }
```

This approach is better , that declare a variable inside a simple block and then the do processing.

After the block is finished executing, the memory allocated to the variable will be deleted.

```cpp
    {
        int c = a + b;
        if (c > 10)
        {
            // do something
        }
    }
```

This feature was introduced in C++17 , and it works exactly same as previous approach.

```cpp
    if(int c = a + b; c > 10)
    {
        // do something
    }
```

Another way to use this feature

```cpp
    if(int e=a*b)
    {
        cout<<e<<endl;
    }
```

There is declaration and assignment in the if condition, which will return true and the block will get executed.

The memory allocated to the variable will be deleted after the block is finished executing.

## Switch case - Branch and control statement

Switch cases are faster than if else ladder.

We can write the default anywhere inside the switch block.
